# CLASSIFICATION-PROBLEM
This project focuses on solving a classification problem using a dataset related to diabetic patients. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a patient is diabetic or not based on various health indicators such as glucose level, BMI, insulin level, age, blood pressure, and other relevant features.
